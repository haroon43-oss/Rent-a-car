                    <p>This ceremony takes place every evening before sunset at the Wagah border, which as part of the Grand Trunk Road was the only road link between these two countries before the opening of the Aman Setu in Kashmir in 1999. The ceremony
                        starts with a blustering parade by the soldiers from both the sides, and ends up in the perfectly coordinated lowering of the two nations’ flags. It is called the beating retreat border ceremony on the international level. One
                        Jawan (infantryman) stands at attention on each side of the gate. As the sun sets, the iron gates at the border are opened and the two flags are lowered simultaneously. The flags are folded and the ceremony ends with a retreat
                        that involves a brusque handshake between soldiers from either side, followed by the closing of the gates again. The spectacle of the ceremony attracts many visitors from both sides of the border, as well as international tourists.

                    <h6>Lahore</h6>
                    <p>Construction of the gardens began on 12 June 1641, and took 18 months to complete. During the Sikh era, much of the garden's marble was pillaged and used to decorate the Golden Temple and the Ram Bagh Palace in nearby Amritsar, while
                        the gardens' costly agate gate was stripped and sold by Lehna Singh Majithia. In 1806 the Maharaja ordered the Shalimar Gardens to be repaired. The Gardens were nationalised in 1962 by General Ayub Khan because leading Arain Mian
                        family members had opposed his imposition of martial law in Pakistan.[citation needed] The annual Mela Chiraghan festival used to take place in the gardens until General Ayub Khan forbade it in 1958.</p>

                    <p>Minar-e-Pakistan, literally “Tower of Pakistan” is a public monument located in Iqbal Park which is one of the largest urban parks in Lahore, Pakistan. The tower was constructed during the 1960s on the site where, on 23 March 1940,
                        the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution, the first official call for a separate homeland for the Muslims living in the South Asia, in accordance with the two nation theory. The foundation stone was laid on 23 March
                        1960. The construction took eight years, and was completed in 1968. The Minar was completed on 31 October 1968 at an estimated cost of Rs. 705,8000. Today, the minaret provides a panoramic view to visitors who can climb up the
                        stairs or through an elevator. The parks around the monument include marble fountains and an artificial lake.</p>
